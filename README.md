## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#### I'm Yash Joshi, currently enrolled to my MSc. in Quantitative Finance at Singapore Management University. I've have ~4 years of work experience as a credit risk portolio analyst at Citibank.

- The subjects in my first term are:
    a. Programming and Computational Finance
    b. Stocahstic Modelling and Calculus in Finance
    c. Asset Pricing
    d. Quantitative Analysis of Financial Markets
- I'm super interested in Asset Pricing and Portfolio management/building.
- The objective of this GitHub is to chart my progress! I started out with minimal experience in Python, although I'm competant with MySQL and SAS EG.
- I hope you find some of the projects I've worked on interesting! Some of them are extensions of assignemnts and projects done at uni.
- My codes aren't the most efficient ones out there, but please bear with me! Hopefully by the end of my journey at SMU, I'll be one of y'all!
- Currently working on adapting the Invariant Stock framewrok for the Carhart four factor model - hope to be able to effciently improve it by factoring another layer of risk.
